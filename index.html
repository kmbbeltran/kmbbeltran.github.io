        <p>Welcome to my webste!<br>
          I am currently a student at Carleton University, in Ottawa, Canada, getting my undergrad in Computer Science <br>

        <p>Grocery Database created for my database class, COMP 3005<br>
        This application has a full functioning simple GUI that shows the products in a grocery store, the employees who work there
        and the different equipment used in different departments<br>
        This was my first work with Java GUI builders and my first introduction to SQL<br>
        The application was built in Eclipse IDE and we used a subset of SQL called SQLite</p>
